# My visual art portfolio

If you asked me what I'm most proud of throughout my childhood and teenage years, I'd say it's this wonderful art journey that you're about to see! Although I don't draw and paint so often as before, I think it's worth making a portfolio website as a remembrance of a substantial part of my upbringing. 

*Thank you, art, for feeding me up! Thank you, art, for being my good companion!*
